# Welcome

## About The Project
This project describes a  method to estimate the interior parts motion in computer tomography image(CT).
In the begining we will focus on one part and later on we will expand it the other parts.
Our work is based on EpicFlow: Edge-Preserving Interpolation of Correspondences for Optical Flow.

## Disclaimer
This project is developed as part of the requirements for a [software engineering final project](http://projects.jce.ac.il/moodle/login/index.php) at the software engineering department - [Azrieli College of Engineering](http://www.jce.ac.il/), Jerusalem, Israel.
